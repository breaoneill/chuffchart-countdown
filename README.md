**Countdown to Reveal** — a focused, static site tracking progress to gender-affirming surgery, combining visual simplicity with private resilience.

Built and maintained by [Breanne](https://chuffchart.org), the project serves as both a motivational anchor and a quiet act of narrative control — reinforcing the steps taken toward transition with dignity, clarity, and intention.
